# JS-notebook

JS-notebook is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.
- Click any text to edit it.
- The code in each code editor is joined tpgether into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you cen refer to it in any following cell!
- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the `show()` function. This is a function build into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values.
- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right of each cell.

All of your changes get saved to the file you opened JS-notebook with. So if you ran `npx jsnote-j serve test.js`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the `test.js` file

# Getting Started

Open any directory you want to save the file in and run `npx jsnote-j serve test.js`
